it should also scan rythms with that orchestra thingy i used to have that could do that and like outline it then the students could record themselves clapping to it
once this was done i would try to sell it to the districts
make it so for every note it will go back and associate exactly the outline of it!
eventually put in alternate fingerings

---- i would then start selling bulk packages to districts
the idea would be the teachers search of enter in pdfs for each studnets thing
the students go onto website and use the class code for all there different music
it could be clarinet trombone you name it
it would put it in and let the students work w/ it

don't need full outline lit just need its results!
dev the spacebar tapping interface

maybe use pre-combined everything logic for testing!
for each note we'll store a max top max bottom max left max right return it w/ this along w what type of note it is
using this we can make it super accurately outlined for the user clicking the notes!

if to things r too close to each other on the same line choose the one on the right
do for the line added back only the current loop y in that middle range!
do something where we run it first w/ lines removed
then we make sure that any new notes aren't inside overlapping notes
then we see if the user clicks on something and it is double notes or what not we will 



 move onto the dashed white -- different logic
for the white notes changed direction maybe do something where it like does changed direction but can't go change again!
eventuallydo the thing where if the note is inside the notes then likes it's bad
